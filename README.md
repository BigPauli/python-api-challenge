___
## WeatherPy
The purpose of WeatherPy was to practice using the OpenWeather API and the pandas and matplotlib libraries. In WeatherPy.ipynb, you will find code that generates a list of random cities around the world using the citipy library. It then draws data from each city using the OpenWeather API, specifically the Max Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed, and performs visual data analysis comparing these parameters.

___
## VacationPy
VacationPy.ipynb uses the hvplot library to plot each city from WeatherPy on a world map. It then filters the cities down to those that have preferable vacation weather. In each of these cities, the script uses the Geoapify API to find the nearest hotel to each of these cities.
___

All code was written with assistance from the NorthWestern Data Science Bootcamp.  Extra help was received from the matplotlib and hvplot docs.
